A sample dataset from Kaggle, containing raw bank loan data for the year 2021, was used for this analysis. Analyzing this data is crucial for maintaining the financial health of a bank and ensuring responsible lending practices.

The data was imported into MSSQL Server, a database was created, and queries were executed to determine key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the total funded amount, amount received, average Debt to Income (DTI) ratio, good loans, bad loans, and regional analysis by state.

Power BI was connected to the SQL database to perform data cleaning, create data tables, and develop data models. A dashboard was designed with a grid view of the bank loan status, incorporating slicers for detailed reports by region. The visualization displayed relevant details such as the total funded amount by purpose (e.g., educational, house, car) and showed the percentage of good and bad loans along with their corresponding statuses.

This analysis enables the bank to make informed lending decisions, such as approving or denying loan requests, assessing the risk associated with lending to specific individuals or businesses, and tailoring loan products and marketing strategies to particular customer segments. Additionally, it helps the bank monitor the health of its loan portfolios, identify underperforming loans, and optimize loan terms and pricing.

Improved Risk Management: By identifying key metrics like the Debt to Income (DTI) ratio and distinguishing between good and bad loans, the bank can make informed lending decisions, minimizing exposure to high-risk loans

Enhanced Profitability: Assessing loan performance by region and purpose allows the bank to tailor loan terms, interest rates, and conditions, maximizing profitability by aligning loan products with customer profiles and market needs.
